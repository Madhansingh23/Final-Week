The project introduces several strategic improvements over traditional manual or basic ML-based e-waste classification methods. First, by leveraging transfer learning using EfficientNetV2B1, the model utilizes pre-trained weights on the ImageNet dataset, enabling it to learn high-level image features even with a relatively small e-waste dataset. This approach significantly improves model accuracy, convergence speed, and generalization capability. Additionally, the use of advanced data augmentation techniques (random flipping, zooming, contrast adjustments) ensures better robustness against overfitting and variance in image quality, which is common in real-world waste collection scenarios.

Second, the solution goes beyond static model evaluation by integrating an interactive Gradio-based user interface, allowing users to test the model with real-time image uploads. This not only makes the model accessible for non-developers but also bridges the gap between experimentation and practical deployment. Visual dashboards using Plotly and Seaborn provide intuitive analysis of model performance (e.g., confusion matrix, loss trends), making it easier to interpret and present results. Together, these improvements make the project more scalable, insightful, and deployment-ready for smart recycling applications or educational demonstrations.
